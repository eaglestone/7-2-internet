Eggs on Toast
Scrambled eggs can be one of the most fantastic, luxurious breakfasts around if you remember a few key things: always use really fresh free-range or organic eggs and good-quality butter, and always keep the eggs moving slowly over a low heat. Do this and you’ll get luscious, buttery, creamy eggs every time.
Ingredients
4 large eggs, preferably free-range or organic
sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
a good lump of butter, plus extra to serve
4 slices of bread

To cook your eggs

Crack your eggs into a bowl
Add a pinch of salt and pepper
Beat well with a fork
Put a small pan over a low heat and add a good lump of butter 
Melt it slowly until it’s frothy 
Pour the eggs into the pan and stir them slowly – use a wooden spoon or a spatula if you have one, so you can get right into the sides of the pan</li>
While you’re doing this, pop some bread on to toast
