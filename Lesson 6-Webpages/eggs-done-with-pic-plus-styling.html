<img src = "http://www.jamieoliver.com/core/images/jhcs/main-image-2543.jpg" />
<p>Scrambled eggs can be one of the most fantastic, luxurious breakfasts around if you remember a few key things: always use really fresh free-range or organic eggs and good-quality butter, and always keep the eggs moving slowly over a low heat. Do this and you’ll get luscious, buttery, creamy eggs every time.<p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>4 large eggs, preferably free-range or organic </li>
<li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper a good lump of butter, plus extra to serve </li>
<li>slices of bread</li>
</ul>
<h2>To cook your eggs</h2>
<ol>
<li>Crack your eggs into a bowl</li>
<li>Add a pinch of salt and pepper</li>
<li>Beat well with a fork</li>
<li>Put a small pan over a low heat and add a good lump of butter </li>
<li>Melt it slowly until it’s frothy </li>
<li>Pour the eggs into the pan and stir them slowly – use a wooden spoon or a spatula if you have one, so you can get right into the sides of the pan</li>
<li>While you’re doing this, pop some bread on to toast</li>
</ol>
